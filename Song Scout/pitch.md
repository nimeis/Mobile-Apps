# Inspiration Statement

## Songscout is a Tinder/TikTok-esque app which helps people find new and unheard songs from underground artists so that these artists can get the recognition they deserve

### 2-3 possible solutions

Songscout:
The app is a social media platform that focuses on discovering new music through short audio clips, similar to TikTok. Users can browse through a feed of short audio clips or songs and swipe left or right to indicate whether they like or dislike the song

Playlist Creator:
Users can create playlists based on a theme or mood, such as a workout playlist, a relaxing playlist, or a party playlist. The app may suggest songs or artists to include in the playlist based on the user's preferences and listening history

Gig Finder:
This app is designed to connect independent musicians with local venues and event organizers who are looking for live music acts to perform at their events

### Initial Idea

We want to make a Tinder / TikTok clone where it is possible to listen to small audio clips (most likely the chorus of a song) and let users like or dislike the song.  Also, it could be possible for the user to dive into the song and listen to the full song, because listening to the chorus is usually not enough to determine if one likes a song or not. Additionally, all liked songs will be put into a playlist on the user's personal Spotify so that they can listen to them even when they are outside of Songscout.  We also want to implement a monthly listener cap, possibly 50000, so that we can give undergound artists a chance to shine.

### Final Idea

We have agreed on all of those previously stated features, but we do want to make the app adapt to your music taste.  Songscout will implement filters so that a user can choose the mood of music they want to listen to.  If a user does not specify any filters, the app will use the Spotify API to get the user's top 5 or so genres and pull music from those genres.  If the person does not authenticate with a Spotify account, the app could display random songs
