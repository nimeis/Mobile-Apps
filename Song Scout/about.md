## Technology Highlights:

Implementation of Spofity API for recommendations

Spotify API playback based on user's Spotify account

Use of Firebase to save the three most recent search result for users to reuse
if they like the recommendations

A Waveform that reacts with the music that is being played by the app currently

App icon of Jukebox (cuz why not?)

### Problems / Issues:

Spotify keeps giving us a 504 Gateway Timeout error, occurring on Postman as well with the same Headers and parameters

Inability to test Waveform iteratively since it only works when the Load Songs button works

### Future Features:
